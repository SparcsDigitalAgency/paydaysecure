								<h3>Who can qualify for a cash advance or payday loan?</h3>

								Be employed in your current position for around 90 days at least
								Be older than 18 years of age, be a US citizen or a permanent resident
								You should have a salary of $1000 each month after tax deductions
								Have a valid email address, work phone number and home phone.
							</div>

							<div id="snav-content2">
								<h3>Will I need a printer or fax machine?</h3>
								You should have printer in order to print out the loan documents. Also the lender who receives your inquiry will also need for you to fax over the information to them. Information such as your bank statement and a pay stub will need to be faxed over. If you do not have a fax machine you can always use ones available at Office Max, Kinkos, Mail Boxes, Stables etc.
							</div>

							<div id="snav-content3">
								<h3>What is the cost?</h3>There is no cost to use PaydaySecure.com matching service. The fees of the loan will vary depending on the amount and the lender. The lender will notify you of the exact fees for the loan once on their website. However, please bear in mind that cash advance loans have been designed with emergency needs in mind and will be lower in terms of expense as compared to late charges, check fees etc. which you may incur if you are late with payments.
							</div>

							<div id="snav-content4">
								<h3>When and how do I repay this loan?</h3>
								Both the loan fees and the amount is withdrawn directly from your checking account once the due date has been reached. You will not have to think twice about it! This saves you from having to visit any store. An extension can be requested by contacting your lender prior to the due date. But there will be additional fees which apply to the extension.
							</div>

							<div id="snav-content5">
								<h3>Is an extension possible on repaying my loan? And how many extensions can I get?</h3>
								The state laws on this differ and dictate if a lender can grant you an extension often referred to as a 'rollover'. While some states allow for multiple rollovers, others do not allow it at all. You should ask your lender about anything concerning rollovers / extensions. Also make sure to contact your lender with an extension request prior to the due date of your payment. If you do not do it in time the lender will charge you additional fee and ask for immediate payment of the remaining balance. Also additional fees and other charges may be levied on you if you default.
